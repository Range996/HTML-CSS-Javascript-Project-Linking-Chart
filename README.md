## Data Description

The data for this assignment comes from the World Bank ([link](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/africa-development-indicators)). It shows, from 1960-2011, the GDP per capita of countries in Africa (based on current USD). 

* `data/Data_Extract_From_Africa_Development_Indicators.xlsx` is the excel file generated and downloaded from The World Bank website using their DataBank interface.
* `data/africa_gdp_per_capita.csv` is the formatted csv file you'll use in the interface. Note that some countries have misssing data for some years (stored as empty strings).
* `data/africa.geojson` is the geojson file used to create the map (ie, the country shapes).
